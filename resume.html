                                I joined Ride Health when there was only the CEO and CTO, and the company has since scaled to 25M+ in revenue and 26 full-time employees. My day to day at Ride Health takes me everywhere in stack, from automating sales processes to building interfaces to architecting complex features. I get to work with the product and sales teams to innovate solutions for underserved and at-risk populations.</p>

                            I began work at Authorea as a contractor, asked to rebuild their website in a month. I completed the job early and was taken on as a full-time employee. Authorea had a team of six engineers, most of whom were strictly back-end developers. I jumped at the chance to lead front-end development for the team. Authorea's product was a mix between Google Docs and Github. I collaborated with the design team to redesign the editing interface, which has a similar visual complexity to a Google Docs document.
